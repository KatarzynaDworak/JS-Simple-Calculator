# JS Simple Calculator

This is a simple calculator application implemented in pure JavaScript, with no frameworks or external libraries. The app supports basic mathematical operations and adheres to the requirements specified in the task.

## Task

The goal was to create a JavaScript application with the following constraints and features:
- **No frameworks or external libraries** for calculations.
- The project structure is organized into appropriate groups.
- **Webpack configuration** ensures the build output contains only two files: `index.html` and `bundle.js`.
- **Functional requirements** include:
  - Division (`/`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Percentage (`%`)
  - Sign change (`Â±`)
- **Technical requirements**:
  - Avoid using `eval` or JavaScript's built-in `Math` library.
  - ESLint was set up with optional integration of Prettier.
  - A pre-commit hook was implemented to prevent code with linting errors from being pushed.
- **Extra Credit**:
  - User-friendly interface with a responsive design.
  - Light and dark theme toggles for a better user experience.
  - Online deployment of the application.

## How to Use the Application

### Install Dependencies
Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/KatarzynaDworak/JS-Simple-Calculator.git

### Navigate to the project folder:

    cd JS-Simple-Calculator

### Install the necessary dependencies:

      npm install

### Development Mode
Run the app locally in development mode with live reloading:

      npm start

This will open the app in your default browser and reload the app whenever changes are made.

### Build for Production
- To build the app for production, run:

      npm run build

- The build output will be located in the dist/ folder and will include the following:

      index.html
      bundle.js

### Deploy the App
The app has been deployed using GitHub Pages. You can view the live application here: [JS Simple Calculator Live](https://katarzynadworak.github.io/JS-Simple-Calculator/)

      Folder Structure
      The project is structured as follows:
          
          JS-Simple-Calculator/
          â”‚
          â”œâ”€â”€ dist/                 # Build output (generated by Webpack)
          â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html        # Compiled HTML file
          â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ bundle.js         # Compiled JavaScript file
          â”‚
          â”œâ”€â”€ src/                  # Source files
          â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html        # Application HTML
          â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.js          # Main JavaScript file (UI logic)
          â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ math.js           # Business logic for calculations
          â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ theme.js          # Theme toggling logic
          â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ style.css         # Application styling
          â”‚
          â”œâ”€â”€ .eslintrc.json        # ESLint configuration
          â”œâ”€â”€ .prettierrc           # Prettier configuration
          â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore            # Ignored files for git
          â”œâ”€â”€ package.json          # Node.js project configuration
          â”œâ”€â”€ webpack.config.js     # Webpack configuration

### Features
**Core Functionalities:**
- Perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- Calculate percentages and toggle the sign of the current number.
  
**Theming:**
- Toggle between light and dark themes for improved usability.

**Optimized Code:**
- Output consists of only two files for deployment: index.html and bundle.js.

**Code Quality:**
- ESLint and Prettier ensure clean and consistent code.
- A pre-commit hook prevents invalid or poorly formatted code from being pushed.

### Remarks
This project follows the standard practices for setting up a JavaScript application without any framework. It utilizes Webpack for bundling, ESLint for code linting, Prettier for formatting, and GitHub Pages for deployment.
